# df-tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthemsteger/df-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthemsteger/df-tools)

**df-tools*** offers Dwarf Fortress related utilities and tools to read and manipulate dwarf fortress files, generate Dwarf Fortress worlds, and otherwise help a player play Dwarf Fortress without resorting to using the (wonderful) [DFHack][DFHack].

The idea behind this library was when I dropped [DFHack][DFHack] to play the latest Dwarf Fortress, which at the time was not supported by [DFHack][DFHack] yet. In that adventure of playing DF without many of the utilities, I wanted some organization and tools to help. This is the utility library meant to be a foundation on that effort.

## Usage

This is not on NPM yet, nor would I expect anyone to use it in this state. The API is in an **extreme** level of flux.
